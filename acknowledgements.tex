Thanks to my committee, who trained and supported me through my Ph.D., and many of whom have known me for almost ten years at this point. You all have been formative to my adulthood and my life as a scholar. A special thanks to David Landy, who took a chance on me as a graduate student and who continued to mentor me even after taking a job across the country at Netflix. 

Thanks to my LandyLab-mates and my GeoLab-mates who made grad school fun even through a pandemic. Lots of thanks and love to Tyler, Brad, Arta, Jack, Mahi, and the Sams. 

Thanks to the church communities who supported me through big life-phases and without whom the last chapter of the dissertation would not have been possible. Thanks to Trinity Episcopal Church--Bloomington, St. Paul's Episcopal Church--Bellingham, Anne Jones, Dr. Marilyn Keiser, and Dr. Dongho Lee. 

A huge, endless thank you to all the parents in my life: to my own parents Jeff and Janice Brower who housed Eli and me throughout all of lockdown and whose love and support has guided me through my life. And thank you to my in-laws: Beth and Dave for opening their home to me and Eli when we moved to Bellingham (and for being the best housemates), and Hud for all the wisdom imparted over breakfast. 

Thank you to my little sister, Lucy, for keeping me sane with FaceTime calls, laughter, and playlists. And thanks to my brother-in-law Masashi for just generally being a chill role model. 

Thank you to the many animals who kept me company across my time as a graduate student: Ruby, Trooper, BoJack, Wally, Ernie, Phoebe, and Fiona. They had no idea why I was so stressed a lot of the time, but they were very happy to alleviate that stress with walks or snuggles. 

Thanks to my wide and deep community of friends, too numerous to name in full. But thank you especially to Claire for the movie nights and the weekly phone calls. Thanks to Casey for doing ballet and grad school alongside me. And thanks to Maddi for being such a good friend in a new place. I love you all. 

And finally, to end my litany of thanks: thank you, Eli. I have no idea what my life would look like without your love (or what my dissertation would look like without your input) and I am so glad that I'll never have to find out. 

Thank you, thank you, thank you.
